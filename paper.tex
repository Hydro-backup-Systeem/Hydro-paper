\section{Introduction}
In hydrogen-powerd endurance racing, uninterupted telmetry and communication between the pitwall and the car are essential for both competitive performance and for driver safety. As systems could fail due to multiple reasons, and cause a loss of communication costing laps or even endager lives, a dedicated low-power backup is required. This paper therefore proposes a long-range wireless solution capable of transmitting and receiving both critiacal sensor data and messages to the driver over distances up to 2km (the approximate diameter of the Le Mans circuit) while only consuming a few milliwatts. By combining a encrypted LoRa-based RF link with embedded speech synthesis and WAV playback on an ultra-low-power STM32U5 microcontroller, our design ensures that even in the event of primary-system failure, the pit-crew retains awareness of the car's most critical data and issue instructions to the driver.

\section{Testing}

\subsection{Test Setup}
The system was evaluated primarily in a laboratory environment. Key aspects such as power consumption, LoRa communication integrity, and audio output functionality were tested. Most tests were conducted manually, involving the transmission of periodic test messages and monitoring system responses via serial output and audio feedback. Power draw was observed using an inline current measurement tool, and LoRa transmissions were validated using logic analyzers and debug logs.

\subsection{Communication Testing}
To verify LoRa communication, encrypted packets were periodically transmitted and received between two system nodes. Tests confirmed successful decryption, CRC validation, and end-to-end data integrity.

\subsection{Audio Output Testing}
WAV file playback was validated by connecting the system's analog output to external speakers and assessing the clarity of preloaded audio samples. Speech synthesis was tested by transmitting predefined sentences to the device and evaluating intelligibility through blind listening tests. Testers rated intelligibility qualitatively. While overall clarity was sufficient for basic commands, future improvements may include tuning output filters and optimizing speech synthesis parameters for better naturalness.
