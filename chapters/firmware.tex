\section{Firmware Design and Implementation}

In this section, we present the design and implementation of the firmware for the STM32U5, which enables two-way raw LoRa communication, speech synthesis
and voice command recognition.

\subsection{Firmware Design}
[Describe the structure of the firmware. Mention FreeRTOS (if used), key modules/tasks, inter-process communication, power handling, interrupt strategies, etc.]

\subsection{Testing and Results}
[Discuss how you verified the system. Include relevant metrics: timing, memory usage, communication robustness, etc. Optionally describe test setups.]

\subsection{Conclusion}
[Summarize what you built, how well it works, and potential areas for improvement or future work.]
